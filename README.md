# Discord-Waifu-Fight

Waifu Fight was a Discord bot where you could get and train Anime Characters (Waifus) to challenge dunjons, while playing osu!, A Rhythm game where you click circles to the beat.
The main purpose of this bot was to create a more linear progression system where you could progress while just playing, in parallel of the skill based progression of rhythm game where the only real progression is to get better at the game.

This project ended due to the inherent limitations that come with an UI interactible only from a Discord bot, which limited a lot of the potentials ideas and made for a clunky UI.
Recently, this project was revived as a web application called Nanina.
