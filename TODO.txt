replace reduce_EX_time by reduce_explo_time



remove all bonus linked to obtaining all waifus it's to say : nakano bonus, for base (origin: nakano, base)
what to do with counciousness key?


Ask for type of map after fight to get map genre (for bonus gc)

IDEA : extracting XP from waifu give souls and counciousness to make copy of a waifu
IDEA : item that let you change URL of waifu (cost GC and money)
IDEA : item XP become item

Make code to know if someone has done a dungeon
Make code to get see where every drop of money, GC and XP come from
Clean up code of globalItemManager (especially the fact getColRand need collection instead of nested arrays)
Modify all language line for actions
expected XP lvl
Add temp variable (?.) in waifu for total damage and most impactful type
